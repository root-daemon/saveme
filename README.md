# SaveMe Protocol Overview
## Project Description
**SaveMe** is a decentralized Web3 security protocol designed to safeguard users' crypto assets from rug pulls and malicious activities. It employs smart contract automation paired with real-time anomaly detection to activate a self-destructing safety mechanism.

## Core Features
- **Real-time Anomaly Detection**: Continuously monitors blockchain transactions for suspicious activities.
- **Automatic Self-Destruct Mechanism**: Engages when threats are detected, ensuring asset safety.
- **Instant Liquidity Conversion and Fund Recovery**: Swiftly converts assets to stable forms and returns them to the owner.
- **Protected Wallet Creation**: Facilitates the creation of wallets with automated monitoring.
- **Transaction Monitoring Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly interface for tracking transaction histories.
## Technical Architecture
### Smart Contract Flow
1. **AnomalyGuard Contract**: Central to detecting and responding to abnormal activities.
2. **LiquidityPool**: Manages the conversion of assets to stable forms.
3. **Wallet**: Stores and monitors user funds.
4. **Protection Flow**:
    - **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies potential threats.
    - **Self-Destruct Mechanism**: Triggers protective actions.
    - **Swap Tokens**: Converts assets via the LiquidityPool.
    - **Return Funds to Owner**: Ensures user assets are secured.
## User Actions
- **Connect Wallet**: Initiate interaction with the protocol by connecting a crypto wallet.
- **Create Protected Wallet**: Establish a wallet with built-in security features.
- **Transfer Funds**: Move assets into the protected environment.
- **Monitor Wallet**: Keep track of wallet activities and ensure security.
- **View Transactions**: Access a detailed history of all transactions within the protocol.
