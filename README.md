## Technical Architecture
### Smart Contract Flow
1. **AnomalyGuard Contract**: Central to detecting and responding to abnormal activities.
2. **LiquidityPool**: Manages the conversion of assets to stable forms.
3. **Wallet**: Stores and monitors user funds.
4. **Protection Flow**:
    - **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies potential threats.
    - **Self-Destruct Mechanism**: Triggers protective actions.
    - **Swap Tokens**: Converts assets via the LiquidityPool.
    - **Return Funds to Owner**: Ensures user assets are secured.
