# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. I, Daniil Krizhanonovskyi, have compiled the following changes and improvements over the course of the project's development. Each version contains a detailed description of the new features, bug fixes, improvements, and any breaking changes that occurred.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2024-09-09

### Added
- **Anomaly Detection**: Integrated Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies in blockchain transaction data. This feature allows users to identify abnormal patterns in high-dimensional datasets, such as fraudulent transactions or unusual activity.
- **ARIMA Time-Series Forecasting**: Added ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time-series forecasting. This allows users to predict future trends in transaction values based on historical data.
- **Etherscan API Integration**: Implemented Etherscan API interaction to fetch real-time blockchain transaction data. Users can input a wallet address and fetch detailed transaction histories directly from the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Data Cleaning**: Developed modules for cleaning and preprocessing blockchain transaction data. This includes removing duplicates, handling missing values, and filtering invalid transactions (e.g., transactions with zero or negative value).
- **Data Transformation**: Added support for transforming raw blockchain data, including converting timestamps to human-readable formats and normalizing numerical fields like transaction values and gas prices.
- **Data Visualization**: Created several visualizations, including time-series plots of transaction activity, anomaly plots that highlight unusual transactions, and distribution plots for analyzing transaction characteristics.
- **Parallel Processing with Dask**: Added support for large-scale data processing with Dask, allowing users to clean and process large blockchain datasets efficiently.
- **Logging and Error Handling**: Introduced structured logging across all modules, ensuring that users can easily trace errors and monitor the system’s performance.
- **Test Suite**: Implemented a comprehensive set of unit tests to ensure the robustness of the main modules, including anomaly detection, API interaction, and data visualization.

### Fixed
- **API Timeout Issues**: Resolved an issue where API requests to Etherscan would occasionally time out during large data pulls. This was addressed by adding retries with exponential backoff and handling rate limits gracefully.

### Changed
- **Improved Documentation**: Provided detailed documentation for all public functions and modules in the project. This includes docstrings in the source code as well as examples in the README.
- **User Feedback and Logging**: Enhanced the user-facing feedback through better log messages and error handling during data processing and API interactions.

### Removed
- **Redundant Functions**: Removed several redundant utility functions in the API interaction module to streamline the codebase and improve performance.

## [0.1.0] - 2024-08-28

### Added
- **Project Initialization**: Initialized the **Blockchain Anomaly Detection** project repository.
- **Basic Data Processing**: Developed early versions of data cleaning and transformation scripts for blockchain transactions.
- **Initial API Integration**: Established basic interaction with the Etherscan API to fetch transaction data from the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Logging**: Added basic logging functionality for monitoring the progress of data processing and API calls.
