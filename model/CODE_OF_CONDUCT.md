# Code of Conduct

Hello, and welcome to the **Blockchain Anomaly Detection** project! My name is Daniil Krizhanonovskyi, and I am the creator of this project. I believe that a healthy and supportive community is essential for the success of any open-source project, and I want to make sure that everyone feels welcome and respected here.

This Code of Conduct outlines my expectations for participants within the community, as well as the steps to follow if any issues arise. I am committed to providing a friendly, safe, and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of background, experience, or identity.

## Our Commitment

As a participant in this project, I am committed to fostering an environment where everyone is treated with respect and dignity. All participants, including contributors, maintainers, and users, are expected to uphold these values:

- **Respect**: We will treat each other with kindness and respect. Disparaging or derogatory comments, personal attacks, and harassment will not be tolerated.
- **Inclusivity**: We welcome contributions from people of all backgrounds and experiences. Discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or any other characteristic will not be allowed.
- **Collaboration**: Collaboration is key to a successful open-source project. We will work together constructively and provide feedback in a helpful, empathetic manner.
- **Patience**: Open-source projects involve people with different levels of expertise. Patience and understanding are crucial when helping others or when seeking help.

## Expected Behavior

To help ensure that everyone has a positive experience, I expect all participants to adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Be Respectful**: Treat others with respect at all times. Harassment, discriminatory language, or personal attacks of any kind are not acceptable.
   
2. **Be Constructive**: Feedback and criticism should always be provided in a constructive manner. When offering feedback, focus on the work rather than the person, and avoid overly negative or harsh comments.

3. **Be Open and Inclusive**: Everyone is welcome to contribute, regardless of their background or experience. Make sure to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable participating.

4. **Respect Different Perspectives**: People have different views, experiences, and opinions. Disagreements should be handled respectfully, and alternative perspectives should be listened to with an open mind.

5. **Help Others**: Offer support and guidance to those who need help. Whether it's explaining a technical concept or providing feedback on code, be patient and supportive.

6. **Respect Boundaries**: Respect the personal boundaries of others, both in terms of behavior and communication. If someone asks to be left alone or not contacted outside of a specific context, their wishes should be respected.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable in the **Blockchain Anomaly Detection** community:

- **Harassment**: This includes any kind of unwelcome behavior that demeans, humiliates, or threatens an individual or group. Examples include sexual comments, inappropriate jokes, and any form of unwanted physical or verbal contact.
  
- **Discrimination**: Discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, nationality, or any other personal characteristic is strictly prohibited.

- **Trolling and Bullying**: Deliberately provoking or harassing others through inflammatory comments, name-calling, or personal attacks will not be tolerated.

- **Violence and Threats**: Any form of violence or threats, whether verbal or physical, will result in immediate expulsion from the community.

## Reporting Incidents

If you experience or witness any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please contact me directly. I take all reports seriously and will take immediate action to investigate and address any issues.

To report a violation, you can email me at **[daniil.krizhanovskyi@hotmail.com]**. When reporting an incident, please include the following information:

- A description of the behavior that occurred.
- Where and when the incident took place (e.g., in the GitHub repository, on social media, etc.).
- Any other relevant information, such as screenshots, links, or witnesses.

Your privacy will be respected, and I will handle all reports with confidentiality. My goal is to resolve issues quickly, fairly, and in a way that makes the community a safe and welcoming place for everyone.

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, I may take any action I deem appropriate, including issuing warnings, temporarily banning users, or permanently expelling them from the community.

Depending on the severity of the violation, I may also take additional actions, such as contacting law enforcement if necessary.

## Acknowledgment

The **Blockchain Anomaly Detection** project is a community-driven initiative, and I am deeply grateful for the contributions of all participants. This Code of Conduct is based on the belief that every individual has the right to participate in the open-source community free from discrimination, harassment, or other harmful behaviors.
