api_utils.py

This module provides utility functions to assist with API requests, such as handling rate limits,
validating responses, and retry logic. These utilities enhance the robustness and scalability of API interactions.

Adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by focusing only on auxiliary API-related tasks.
